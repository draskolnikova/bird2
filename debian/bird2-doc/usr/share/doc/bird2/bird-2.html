<H2><A NAME="routing-tables"></A> <A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="bird.html#toc2.1">Routing tables</A>
</H2>

<P>The heart of BIRD is a routing table. BIRD has several independent routing tables;
each of them contains routes of exactly one <I>nettype</I> (see below). There are two
default tables -- <CODE>master4</CODE> for IPv4 routes and <CODE>master6</CODE> for IPv6 routes.
Other tables must be explicitly configured.
<P>
<P>These routing tables are not kernel forwarding tables. No forwarding is done by
BIRD. If you want to forward packets using the routes in BIRD tables, you may
use the Kernel protocol (see below) to synchronize them with kernel FIBs.
<P>
<P>Every nettype defines a (kind of) primary key on routes. Every route source can
supply one route for every possible primary key; new route announcement replaces
the old route from the same source, keeping other routes intact. BIRD always
chooses the best route for each primary key among the known routes and keeps the
others as suboptimal. When the best route is retracted, BIRD re-runs the best
route selection algorithm to find the current best route.
<P>
<P>The global best route selection algorithm is (roughly) as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Preferences of the routes are compared.</LI>
<LI>Source protocol instance preferences are compared.</LI>
<LI>If source protocols are the same (e.g. BGP vs. BGP), the protocol's route selection algorithm is invoked.</LI>
<LI>If source protocols are different (e.g. BGP vs. OSPF), result of the algorithm is undefined.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="dsc-table-sorted"></A> Usually, a routing table just chooses a selected
route from a list of entries for one network. But if the <CODE>sorted</CODE> option is
activated, these lists of entries are kept completely sorted (according to
preference or some protocol-dependent metric). This is needed for some features
of some protocols (e.g. <CODE>secondary</CODE> option of BGP protocol, which allows to
accept not just a selected route, but the first route (in the sorted list) that
is accepted by filters), but it is incompatible with some other features (e.g.
<CODE>deterministic med</CODE> option of BGP protocol, which activates a way of choosing
selected route that cannot be described using comparison and ordering). Minor
advantage is that routes are shown sorted in <CODE>show route</CODE>, minor disadvantage
is that it is slightly more computationally expensive.

<H2><A NAME="routes"></A> <A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="bird.html#toc2.2">Routes and network types</A>
</H2>

<P>BIRD works with several types of routes. Some of them are typical IP routes,
others are better described as forwarding rules. We call them all routes,
regardless of this difference.
<P>
<P>Every route consists of several attributes (read more about them in the
<A HREF="bird-5.html#route-attributes">Route attributes</A> section); the common for all
routes are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>IP address of router which told us about this route</LI>
<LI>Source protocol instance</LI>
<LI>Route preference</LI>
<LI>Optional attributes defined by protocols</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Other attributes depend on nettypes. Some of them are part of the primary key, these are marked (PK).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ip-routes"></A> IPv4 and IPv6 routes</H3>

<P>The traditional routes. Configuration keywords are <CODE>ipv4</CODE> and <CODE>ipv6</CODE>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(PK) Route destination (IP prefix together with its length)</LI>
<LI>Route next hops (see below)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ip-sadr-routes"></A> IPv6 source-specific routes</H3>

<P>The IPv6 routes containing both destination and source prefix. They are used
for source-specific routing (SSR), also called source-address dependent routing
(SADR), see <A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8043">RFC 8043</A>. Currently limited mostly to the Babel protocol.
Configuration keyword is <CODE>ipv6 sadr</CODE>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(PK) Route destination (IP prefix together with its length)</LI>
<LI>(PK) Route source (IP prefix together with its length)</LI>
<LI>Route next hops (see below)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="vpn-routes"></A> VPN IPv4 and IPv6 routes</H3>

<P>Routes for IPv4 and IPv6 with VPN Route Distinguisher (<A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4364">RFC 4364</A>).
Configuration keywords are <CODE>vpn4</CODE> and <CODE>vpn6</CODE>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(PK) Route destination (IP prefix together with its length)</LI>
<LI>(PK) Route distinguisher (according to <A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4364">RFC 4364</A>)</LI>
<LI>Route next hops</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="roa-routes"></A> Route Origin Authorization for IPv4 and IPv6</H3>

<P>These entries can be used to validate route origination of BGP routes.
A ROA entry specifies prefixes which could be originated by an AS number.
Their keywords are <CODE>roa4</CODE> and <CODE>roa6</CODE>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(PK) IP prefix together with its length</LI>
<LI>(PK) Matching prefix maximal length</LI>
<LI>(PK) AS number</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="flow-routes"></A> Flowspec for IPv4 and IPv6</H3>

<P>Flowspec rules are a form of firewall and traffic flow control rules
distributed mostly via BGP. These rules may help the operators stop various
network attacks in the beginning before eating up the whole bandwidth.
Configuration keywords are <CODE>flow4</CODE> and <CODE>flow6</CODE>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(PK) IP prefix together with its length</LI>
<LI>(PK) Flow definition data</LI>
<LI>Flow action (encoded internally as BGP communities according to <A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5575">RFC 5575</A>)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="mpls-routes"></A> MPLS switching rules</H3>

<P>This nettype is currently a stub before implementing more support of <A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3031">RFC 3031</A>.
BIRD currently does not support any label distribution protocol nor any label assignment method.
Only the Kernel, Pipe and Static protocols can use MPLS tables.
Configuration keyword is <CODE>mpls</CODE>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>(PK) MPLS label</LI>
<LI>Route next hops</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="route-next-hop"></A> Route next hops</H3>

<P>This is not a nettype. The route next hop is a complex attribute common for many
nettypes as you can see before. Every next hop has its assigned device
(either assumed from its IP address or set explicitly). It may have also
an IP address and an MPLS stack (one or both independently).
Maximal MPLS stack depth is set (in compile time) to 8 labels.
<P>
<P>Every route (when eligible to have a next hop) can have more than one next hop.
In that case, every next hop has also its weight.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="protocols-concept"></A> <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="bird.html#toc2.3">Protocols and channels</A>
</H2>

<P>BIRD protocol is an abstract class of producers and consumers of the routes.
Each protocol may run in multiple instances and bind on one side to route
tables via channels, on the other side to specified listen sockets (BGP),
interfaces (Babel, OSPF, RIP), APIs (Kernel, Direct), or nothing (Static, Pipe).
<P>
<P>There are also two protocols that do not have any channels -- BFD and Device.
Both of them are kind of service for other protocols.
<P>
<P>Each protocol is connected to a routing table through a channel. Some protocols
support only one channel (OSPF, RIP), some protocols support more channels (BGP, Direct).
Each channel has two filters which can accept, reject and modify the routes.
An <I>export</I> filter is applied to routes passed from the routing table to the protocol,
an <I>import</I> filter is applied to routes in the opposite direction.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="graceful-restart"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="bird.html#toc2.4">Graceful restart</A>
</H2>

<P>When BIRD is started after restart or crash, it repopulates routing tables in
an uncoordinated manner, like after clean start. This may be impractical in some
cases, because if the forwarding plane (i.e. kernel routing tables) remains
intact, then its synchronization with BIRD would temporarily disrupt packet
forwarding until protocols converge. Graceful restart is a mechanism that could
help with this issue. Generally, it works by starting protocols and letting them
repopulate routing tables while deferring route propagation until protocols
acknowledge their convergence. Note that graceful restart behavior have to be
configured for all relevant protocols and requires protocol-specific support
(currently implemented for Kernel and BGP protocols), it is activated for
particular boot by option <CODE>-R</CODE>.
<P>
<P>Some protocols (e.g. BGP) could be restarted gracefully after both
intentional outage and crash, while others (e.g. OSPF) after intentional outage
only. For planned graceful restart, BIRD must be shut down by
<A HREF="bird-4.html#cli-graceful-restart">graceful restart</A> command instead of
regular 
<A HREF="bird-4.html#cli-down">down</A> command. In this way routing neighbors
are notified about planned graceful restart and routes are kept in kernel table
after shutdown.
